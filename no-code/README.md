### **💡 Inspiration & Examples**
Before you start building, check out these portfolio sites created with the same no-code tools. Use them as references for layout, structure, and content ideas.

- **Squarespace** -> [Beautiful Portfolio Templates](https://www.squarespace.com/templates/browse/topic/popular-designs/type/portfolio)
- **Wix.com** -> [Wix Portfolio Templates](https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/portfolio-cv/portfolios)
- **WordPress** -> [WordPress portfolio templates](https://wordpress.com/themes/filter/subject:portfolio) You can actually build websites with WordPress alongside their finetuned LLM built for website design. This is super powerful but you might end up paying a little because of the amount of work required to build a good website with LLMs.
- **Canva** -> [Canva templates](https://www.canva.com/templates/s/portfolio/)
- **Notion + Super.so** -> [Explore Notion portfolio templates](https://www.notion.com/templates/category/portfolio?srsltid=AfmBOoo_ed__DvDOG9Ps3IJA9qhWYQHI3bmX7sZtqa4TyMkjfB_vAI0Z)

# üî¥ **Pathway 2 ‚Äî Custom Code Powered Site (Astro / Hugo / Jekyll)**

This pathway is for members who want to **focus on content and presentation first**, while still being able to extend with **custom styles, components, and animations** later.
Your site becomes a **living portfolio and blog**, powered by Markdown for content management.
We'll rely on **LLM guidance** to scaffold templates, configure themes, and gradually add interactivity if desired.


## ‚úÖ Week 1: Build Your LinkedIn Profile

### üñºÔ∏è Profile Picture

* [ ] Upload a professional headshot (plain background, good lighting, natural smile).
* [ ] If you don‚Äôt have one, generate with an AI headshot tool (ensure it looks realistic).
* [ ] (Optional) Go and get a headshot taken from a professional studio.


### üè∑Ô∏è Headline & Tagline

* [ ] Brainstorm 3‚Äì5 headline options.
* [ ] Use this prompt to generate recruiter-friendly headlines:

```
Act as a professional career coach and LinkedIn expert. I want to create a compelling LinkedIn headline and tagline.

Here is my information:
- Target Role/Industry: [e.g., Junior Full-Stack Developer, UX/UI Designer for FinTech, Data Analyst]
- My Top 3-5 Skills: [e.g., React, Node.js, SQL, Figma, User Research, Python, Pandas]
- My Core Professional Interest: [e.g., building scalable web applications, creating intuitive user interfaces, deriving insights from complex datasets]
- A unique quality about me: [e.g., "I'm passionate about clean code," "I love solving complex user problems," "I have a background in finance which gives me unique domain knowledge"]

Based on this, generate 5 different LinkedIn headline options for me. The headlines should be concise (under 220 characters), include relevant keywords for my target industry, and highlight my key value proposition.
```


### üìñ About Section

* [ ] Draft a 150‚Äì250 word summary (who you are, skills, achievements, aspirations).
* [ ] Use this prompt to create/refine:

```
Act as a professional LinkedIn summary writer. I want to create a concise, engaging, and professional About section.

Here is my information:
- Current Role/Background: [e.g., MSc in Data Science, 2 years experience as a Business Analyst]
- Skills/Expertise: [e.g., Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, NLP]
- Achievements (in STAR format if possible): [e.g., automated reporting system saving 15 hours/week, built churn prediction model with 85% accuracy]
- Career Aspirations: [e.g., becoming a Machine Learning Engineer in the healthcare sector]

Please generate 2‚Äì3 versions of an About section (150‚Äì250 words) that highlight my skills, experience, and aspirations in a way that is recruiter-friendly, engaging, and authentic.
```


### üíº Experience Section

* [ ] For each role/project, write 3‚Äì5 bullet points in STAR format.
* [ ] Use this prompt for achievement-oriented bullets:

```
Act as a professional resume writer. I need to write a compelling, achievement-oriented bullet point for my experience section using the STAR method.

Here is the information for one of my achievements:
- My Role: [e.g., Software Development Intern]
- The Company: [e.g., Tech Solutions Inc.]
- The Situation: [e.g., The customer support team was manually spending hours each week answering the same basic questions from users.]
- The Task: [e.g., I was tasked with developing a solution to automate responses to frequently asked questions to save the team time.]
- The Action I Took: [e.g., I designed, built, and deployed a simple chatbot for the company's main website using JavaScript and the Dialogflow API. I integrated it with their existing knowledge base.]
- The Result: [e.g., The chatbot successfully handled an estimated 40% of incoming user queries, which saved the support team approximately 8 hours of work per week. It also improved user response time.]

Please generate 3 variations of a concise, professional bullet point for my LinkedIn profile based on this information. Start the bullet point with an action verb.
```


### üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Endorsements

* [ ] Add 10‚Äì15 relevant skills (Python, SQL, ML, Deep Learning, Generative AI, etc.).
* [ ] Reorder to show top 3‚Äì5 first.
* [ ] Ask 1‚Äì2 peers to endorse your top skills.


### üåü Extras (Optional but Valuable)

* [ ] Customize LinkedIn URL (e.g., linkedin.com/in/firstname-lastname).
* [ ] Add featured links (GitHub, portfolio, blog, projects).
* [ ] Request at least one recommendation (peer, mentor, or manager).
